If you are contributing code to the UAH project, the preferred way to receive credit/recognition 
is Git commit authorship.  Please ensure your Git credentials are properly linked to your GitHub 
account so you appear as a UAH contributor on GitHub.  We do not have a standard for putting 
authors' names directly in the source code, so it is discouraged.
